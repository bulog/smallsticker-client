## Technical Overview

This store is built with data from:

- [Strapi](https://strapi.io)
- The [strapi-sdk-javascript](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-sdk-javascript)

Weâ€™re using [Gatsby V2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) to get the data on screen.

The store is statically rendered using the gatsby-source-strapi plugin, and the order search dashboard is a dynamic app (e.g. client-only routes) protected by GitHub OAuth.
